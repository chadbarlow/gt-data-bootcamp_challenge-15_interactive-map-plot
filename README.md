<h1 align="left"> INTERACTIVE MAP PLOT<br><i>Topic: Earthquakes</i> </h1> 

The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly and interactive visualization tool for earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The main goals are to help users explore earthquake data and understand the magnitude, depth, and location of seismic events.
